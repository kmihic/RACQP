This directory includes scripts that run test to verify SVM results presented in Zhu, M., Mihic, K. and Ye, Y., 2019. On a Randomized Multi-Block ADMM for Solving Selected Machine Learning Problems. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.01995.

The code depends on RACQP solver and LIBSVM. Please update addpath(.) lines to reflect the place where the code resides in your filesystem.

An example on how to use the code is shown in runSVM bash script.

Note: the implementation assumes linux OS is used. If macOS or windows is used, please update get_free_memory.m to use the proper call for free memory information.
